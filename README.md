# 🌧️ Rainfall Prediction Using Machine Learning
# Overview

This repository presents a machine learning based system for forecasting whether it will rain the next day using historical weather data. The project applies data preprocessing techniques, feature engineering, and predictive modeling to generate accurate short-term rainfall predictions that can support daily planning and decision-making.
The goal is to demonstrate a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow from raw data to trained models and performance evaluation while maintaining transparency and reproducibility.
